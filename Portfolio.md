# Portfolio website
Portfolio website is **a responsive website** that has been developed using HTML (flexbox layout) and CSS. this website displays a set of my projects that have developed though a Full-Stack web developer ND and one of my project that still under process.

## Important Information
To Make the website a responsive one, set of breakpoints have been considered:
- The Main design has been built for Nexus5 view port
- The design has been edited for Ipad viewport using 
    ```
     @media screen and (min-width:361px) and (max-width:768px){
     ```
    where, min-width refers to the Nexus5 width's +1 and max-width refers to the Ipad's width
- The design has been edited for Desktop view port that its width=1280px
    ```
     @media screen and (min-width:769px) and (max-width:1280px){
     ```
    where, min-width refers to the Ipad's width+1 and max-width refers to the Desktop(1280px) width
- The design has been edited for Desktop viewport that its width=1366px
    ```
     @media screen and (min-width:1281px) and (max-width:1366px){
     ```
    where, min-width refers to the Desktop(1280px) width+1 and max-width refers to the Desktop(1366px)s width

also, to consider a flexbox layout a set of its properties have been used such as ` display:flex; flex-direction:column; and  justify-content:space-between;
